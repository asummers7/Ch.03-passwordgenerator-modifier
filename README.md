# PasswordGenerator-Modifier 

undefined

## Description
This project started off with a basic HTML, and CSS template. It was my duty to implement JavaScript functionality that allowed a user of the project to generate a random password. This password was to contain (upon the discretion of the user) numbers, letters, and special characters. And it was to be a length, determined by the user, of between 8 and 120 characters.
